2012-07-24 version 6.7

	- Add a workaround for a squidGuard bug that unescape the URL and
	  send it back unescaped. This result in garbage staying into pipe
	  of the system command call and could crash squidclamav on next
	  read or return false information. This is specially true with URL
	  containing the %0D or %0A character. Thanks to John Xue for the
	  report.

2012-05-28 version 6.6

	- Rewrite entirely the squidclamav behavior with the maxsize directive.
	  The previous fix was only a workaround.
	- Fix a bug on 'trustclient' check part that was never executed if
	  dnslookup was disabled. Thanks to Tinu for the report.

2012-01-15 version 6.5

	- Fix a squidclamav crash when maxsize is removed from configuration
	  file or disabled/set to 0. Thanks to Pascal Bendeich for the report.
	- Fix an issue when downloaded file size is upper than clamd.conf limit
	  set into the StreamMaxLength configuration directive. Thanks to Arnvid
	  Karstad for the report.
	- All cgi Perl script have been modified to report unsafe browsing.
	- Add a note about ClamAV and the support for Google Safe Browsing
	  database. As clamd will returned something like:
		Safebrowsing.<something> FOUND
	  this will be redirected by squidclamav just like if a virus was found.
	  Thanks to Michael Grasso for the request.


2011-08-19 version 6.4

	- Change default value for clamd_local configuration directive to the
	  common package default clamd local socket '/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl'.
	- The origin of the double free corruption was partially found in last
	  release. It is now completely fixed. Thanks to Tim Weippert for the
	  report.
	- The call to squidGuard from SquidClamav by a bidirectional pipe seem
	  to make squid/c-icap system going slower and slower. The reason comes
	  from more and more pending squidGuard processes after c-icap thread
	  restarting. The historical reason of this feature is related to Squid
	  version 2.x that doesn't allow to chained url_rewrite_program. I think
	  this is no more useful so the squidguard configuration directive will
	  be removed in next major release. Thank to Marco Schuth and David
	  Tannheimeri for the report.
	  You'd better use the Squid configuration file (squid.conf) and the
	  'url_rewrite_program' directive to use squidGuard. There's no plan to
	  reintroduce the call to squidGuard from SquidClamav at least until
	  squidGuard has a daemon mode or you really asked for it.
	- Fix an issue on reallocating mishandled null pattern array.


2011-06-26 version 6.3

	- Remove obsolete code on log_file configuration directive.
	- Fix double free corruption when sending a configuration reload
	  command: echo -n "squidclamav:cfgreload" >> /var/run/c-icap/c-icap.ctl
	  Thanks to David Tannheimer for the report. This bug appears only when
	  using local Unix socket to connect clamd.
	- Compatibility check with c-icap-0.1.6: ok

2011-02-26 version 6.2

	- Fix squidclamav crash when X-Client-IP is not forwarded by default
	  from squid to icap, i-e: when 'icap_send_client_ip on' is not set
	  into squid.conf. Thanks to Diego Elio Petten√≤ for the patch.
	- Force client Ip and Username to '-' when they are not set or null.
	  Thanks to Alex for the report.
	- Fix a signal 11 when username was not set.
	- Add new configuration option 'dnslookup' to disable DNS lookup of
	  client ip address. Default is enabled for backward compatibility but
	  you may desactivate this feature if you don't use trustclient with
	  hostname in the regexp. Disabling it will also speed up squidclamav.

2010-10-29 version 6.1

	- Add missing "#include <signal.h>", compilation on BSD and possibly
	  other distribution was not working. Thanks to Alex for the report.
	- Fix segmentation fault by gethostbyaddr when remote client can't be
	  resolved. Thank to Valery for the report.

2010-10-21 version 6.0

	This is the initial release of the v6.x branch. It works exactly as
	v5.x branch except that it now use the ICAP protocol and must be run
	as a c-icap server service. The goal of this first release is to port
	SquidClamav to the ICAP protocol to solve all limitations encountered
	in the previous releases (audio/video streaming, site with session like
	webmail, support of POST request, etc).

	Next release will tend to have real on stream scanning and bypass the
	size limitation. Coming soon, but I first want to be sure that c-icap
	is the good choose for stability and performance but also that this new 
	branch is stable and speed enough. I hope you make me feedback.

	This release needs squid v3.x and the c-icap server.

	Also there's no packaging available yet.

	The squidclamav.conf configuration file from v5.x is fully compatible
	but some directives are now obsolete, here is the list:

		squid_ip
		squid_port
		maxredir
		useragent
		trust_cache
		stat
		debug
		clamd_timeout

	One have change, this is the 'timeout' directive that was used to set
	the timeout for libcurl download. As cURL is no more used, this timeout
	directive is now used to set the timeout for clamd connect. His default
	value is 1 second and can be set up to 10.

	Others works as before.

	YOU MUST tune the c-icap server following your need (number of users),
	see http://squidclamav.darold.net/tuning.html for the configuration
	directive that could help.
